To optimize XSLT processing, the extension needs to know the locations of the XSLT templates at build time.
The XSLT source URIs have to be passed via the `quarkus.camel.xslt.sources` property. Multiple URIs can be separated
by comma.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.camel.xslt.sources = transform.xsl, classpath:path/to/my/file.xsl
----

Scheme-less URIs are interpreted as `classpath:` URIs.

Only `classpath:` URIs are supported on Quarkus. `file:`, `http:` and other kinds of URIs do not work by design.

=== Configuration
TransformerFactory features can be configured using following property:
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.camel.xslt.features."http\://javax.xml.XMLConstants/feature/secure-processing"=false
----
=== Extension functions support
https://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/extensions.html[Xalan's extension functions]
do work properly only when they are defined in a separate jar.

[NOTE]
====
The content of the XSLT source URIs is parsed and compiled into Java classes at build time. These Java classes are the
only source of XSLT information at runtime. The XSLT source files may not be included in the application archive at all.

[WARNING]
====
the extension does not yet support Java 11.
